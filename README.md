# PrimaryConflict
This is a small game that I thought up for fun. Its real messy.

At the moment the game is really just a shell of what I hoped it would be. It gets buggier the longer you try to play, though the first round seems solid. after that it has
damage issues. The wins start getting messed up and the colors do not display correctly.
I hope to continue to look into this code and 1. Make the code easier to follow. 2. try to make the code less repetitive. and 3. Become  a seemless cute click and watch waste
of time. ENJOY!
